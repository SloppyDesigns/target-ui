# Target UI Update
Little Different UI for ox_target/qtarget/qb-target

The UI was inspired and full credit to Naiko with the showcase of the [Enhanced HUD](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-enhanced-hud/634217)

## Installation
- Copy And Replace your target folder with the one in the download (Don't delete anything, just overwrite it)
- Restart your target

## Changing Colors
- Makes the thin circle line when not active
```css
#eye {
  border: 1px solid #ffffff;
}
```

- Makes the circle when active with the close icon
```css
#eye.active {
  background: #ffffff;
}
```

- Each option (Sets the text and the background color)
```css
#options-wrapper li a {
  color: #181b20;
  background: white;
}
```
